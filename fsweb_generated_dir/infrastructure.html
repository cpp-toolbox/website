        <h3><a href="https://github.com/cpp-toolbox/build_notifier">build_notifier</a></h3>
        <p>Every project here uses conan for package management, so you usually have to run the command <code>cmake --build --preset conan-release</code> multiple times. This notifier makes it easier by playing a success or fail sound when compilation finishes, so you can stop staring at the build process and continue working in the meantime.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/cpp-toolbox/sbpt">sbpt</a></h3>
        <p>When subprojects use other subprojects, you usually have to hard-code includes to those locations, which differ based on file structure. This script was created to fix this issue.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/cpp-toolbox/cpp_file_generator">cpp_file_generator</a></h3>
        <p>IDE's have a lot of features, but language servers are catching up. One feature that's nice but missing is simply creating new <code>.cpp</code>/<code>.hpp</code> pairs for a new class or file you want to make. This generator does so.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/cpp-toolbox/editor_configurations">editor_configurations</a></h3>
        <p>When working with a cpp-toolbox project, there are usually four main things you want to do: build, run, debug the program, and use git. This repository facilitates these tasks simply for various editors. For example, to start Neovim with terminals opened (in buffers), run <code>python scripts/editor_configurations/launch_nvim.py</code> or from a running instance of nvim, <code>:source scripts/editor_configurations/cpp_terminal_autostart.vim</code>.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/cpp-toolbox/cpp_project_bootstrapper">cpp_project_bootstrapper</a></h3>
        <p>Creating new cpp projects can be time-consuming, as setting up the required files takes time away from coding. In our context, we have to make multiple projects for testing purposes and creating MWE’s. This script helps manage that process quickly.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/cpp-toolbox/process_changes_in_submodules">process_changes_in_submodules</a></h3>
        <p>When working on projects mainly composed of submodules, committing changes can be cumbersome because you must visit each submodule separately to commit them. This script simplifies the process by reducing the moving around and finding necessary changes.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/cpp-toolbox/cpp_tbx_submodule_adder">cpp_tbx_submodule_adder</a></h3>
        <p>Adding submodules can be cumbersome. To see the available submodules, you’d typically look at the web interface, go to the project, copy the clone URL, and so on. This script provides a command-line interface to list and select submodules automatically.</p>
