<h1>shaders</h1>
<p>this is where we store all the shader files for our projects</p>
<h2>compilation</h2>
<p>Our shaders allow you to use <code>#include "your_code_file.glsl</code> and thus you must compile the shaders first by using the command
<code>python main.py src out</code></p>
<h2>note</h2>
<p>There is a differentiation between a shader and a shader file. When we say shader, we are referring to a "shader program" which consists of multiple shader files, each of which either contributes to the fragment or shader part of the entire shader program, to learn about which shader programs are available please visit the shader standard.</p>
<h2>batching</h2>
<p>When creating new shaders, you'll probably want to combine multiple draw calls using this shader into one big draw call, please see the batcher subproject which reads in a shadre and will generate you a batcher class that will work for that shader</p>
