        We have built an editor using cpp_toolbox, it is very much a work in progress now, but allows for basic editing, it takes inspiration from vim:
    </p>
    <h3>Roadmap</h3>
    <p>
        This is what's to come:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>make the search functionality just as good as nvim</li>
        <li>improve command runner to use regex-based command running</li>
        <li>improve the file opening and allow buffers</li>
        <li>allow window splitting through multiple viewports</li>
        <li>make history queue better, more stable</li>
        <li>add c++-specific commands to switch files, buffers</li>
        <li>implementing a language server protocol client, and incorporating into editor</li>
        <li>syntax highlighting</li>
        <li>multiuser editing</li>
        <ul>
            <li>create an ModalEditingVieport class which holds a viewport and all the extra information needed to run the editor in single user mode</li>
            <li>the server must hold a list of buffers and their current state, they cannot be unique to the viewport, so the viewport must point to that list</li>
            <li>the ModalEditingViewports have the command string and on each iteration we check the string and the mode for each active viewport and then do modifications based on that.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>snippit expansion</li>
        <li>windows/macos/linux installation wizard</li>
        <li>make icon</li>
        <li>option to install through steam</li>
        <li>(potentially) sound effects which can be toggled based on settings</li>
        <li>settings GUI</li>
        <li>config file to read in settings</li>
        <li>get font which isn't copyrighted</li>
    </ul>
